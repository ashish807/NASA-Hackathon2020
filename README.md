# NASA_Hackathon2020
This project uses several APIs in order to ask for help with people nearby or contact your local authorities.There are three major features:

Sending an SOS messege to people nearby you.
To contacts button that would send the message to your contacts about your location.
Contacting to the nearest authority. Following is the screenshot of home page

Main aim of this project is to spread the alert quickly among the large amount of people in the certain areas.

Suppose the fire is going to take place in the building, now lets suppose someone in the building saw that fire is changing its status, like growing bigger and bigger so what he can do is open the app and he just has to do one click, alert meassage will be sent to all the people in the building, by this we can quickly and before the fire takes it massive appearence, we can empty the building and hence saving the lives

This project doesnot only stop here, suppose Earthquake measuring center got the information for the computer that there will be a earthquake after 20 seconds (It might be like impossible to predict early on but lets suppose) then what they can be do is by just one tab they can notify people who are within 20km radius from the office, and people who got this notification again by one tab can sent the notification to people who are within 20km radius from sending person, by this we can notify the whole town at once. It might be different in real case scenario.

Now here you can add your contacts, accodring to, to whom you want to sent the trouble message when your are in trouble.

Now the real magic is inside the 'SOS' button as soon as you click on the 'SOS' button you will get something like:

Here you can see location of the all the users, and if you want to give alert message you can type that also, as soon as you click submit button, people around 20km from you will get the notification of your alert and message you typed.

And in the Home page you can also see a 'Contacts' button, so what it does is, it will sent the notification to  only those who are in your contact list

Plus we have created a Fire Detection model, which will alert the authorities when fire take place, in this model we have included the smoke detetection also so that the authorites will get notify before fire show its aggressive nature.
